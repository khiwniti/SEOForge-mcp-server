# Dependency Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully cleaned up and reorganized the SEOForge MCP Server repository to improve maintainability, reduce clutter, and standardize dependencies.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependency Consolidation
- **Python Dependencies**: Consolidated and cleaned up requirements across multiple files
  - Updated `requirements.txt` with core dependencies only
  - Cleaned up `backend/requirements.txt` with organized sections
  - Updated `backend/pyproject.toml` with consistent versions
  - Created `requirements-consolidated.txt` for comprehensive dependency reference
  - Removed version conflicts and duplicates

- **Node.js Dependencies**: Standardized package.json files
  - Updated root `package.json` with consistent naming and versioning
  - Removed redundant lock files (`yarn.lock`, `uv.lock`)
  - Maintained consistency across frontend and MCP server packages

### 2. Project Structure Reorganization

### 3. Security and Cleanup
- **Removed Sensitive Files**: Deleted `.env` files containing API keys and secrets
