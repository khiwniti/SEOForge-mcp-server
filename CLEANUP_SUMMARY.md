# SEOForge MCP Server - Dependency Cleanup & Express Backend Setup

## ðŸŽ‰ Completed Successfully!

### Overview
Successfully cleaned up dependencies and set up Express backend for Vercel deployment. Switched from FastAPI (Python) to Express.js (Node.js) as the primary backend.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependency Consolidation
- **Python Dependencies**: Consolidated and cleaned up requirements across multiple files
  - Updated `requirements.txt` with core dependencies only
  - Cleaned up `backend/requirements.txt` with organized sections
  - Updated `backend/pyproject.toml` with consistent versions
  - Created `requirements-consolidated.txt` for comprehensive dependency reference
  - Removed version conflicts and duplicates

- **Node.js Dependencies**: Standardized package.json files
  - Updated root `package.json` with consistent naming and versioning
  - Removed redundant lock files (`yarn.lock`, `uv.lock`)
  - Maintained consistency across frontend and MCP server packages

### 2. Project Structure Reorganization
- **Documentation**: Moved 51 markdown files from root to `docs/` directory
- **Tests**: Organized all test files (HTML and Python) into `tests/` directory
- **Archives**: Moved 15 ZIP release files to `releases/` directory
- **Generated Content**: Cleaned up temporary files and generated images

### 3. Security and Cleanup
- **Removed Sensitive Files**: Deleted `.env` files containing API keys and secrets
- **Cleaned Temporary Files**: Removed browser screenshots, generated images, and log files
- **Updated .gitignore**: Enhanced to prevent future clutter and sensitive file commits

### 4. File Removals
- 110+ browser screenshot files
- 17 generated image files
- 15 ZIP archive files from root
- Multiple redundant documentation files
- Sensitive environment files
- Lock files and temporary files

### 5. Standardization
- **Project Naming**: Standardized to "seoforge-mcp-server" across all package files
- **Versioning**: Aligned version numbers to 1.2.0 for consistency
- **Author Information**: Unified author information as "SEOForge Team"
