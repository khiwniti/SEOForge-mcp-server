# Run deployment script
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

### 2. Manual Configuration Steps

#### Update Environment Variables
```bash
# Edit production environment file
nano /opt/seoforge/.env

# Required variables to update:
# - DATABASE_URL (your RDS endpoint)

# - OPENAI_API_KEY
# - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# - GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
# - CORS_ORIGINS (your domain)
# - SECRET_KEY (generate new)
# - JWT_SECRET (generate new)
```

#### Configure Nginx
```bash
# Update domain in nginx config
sudo nano /opt/seoforge/nginx/nginx.prod.conf

# Replace yourdomain.com with your actual domain
# Update SSL certificate paths if needed
```

#### Database Initialization
```bash
# Connect to your RDS instance and run initialization script
psql -h your-rds-endpoint -U username -d seoforge < database/init.sql
```

### 3. Service Startup
```bash
cd /opt/seoforge

# Start all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Check service status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f
```

docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs backend

# Check environment variables
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend env

# Check database connectivity
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend python -c "import psycopg2; print('DB OK')"
```

#### High Response Times
```bash
# Check system resources
htop
df -h
free -m

# Check database performance
# Monitor slow queries in RDS console

# Check Redis performance
redis-cli info stats
```

#### SSL Certificate Issues
```bash
# Check certificate status
sudo certbot certificates

# Renew certificate
sudo certbot renew

# Test SSL configuration
openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443
```
